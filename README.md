# BJParametersRecommendationSystem
This is a matlab app built based on BP-NN learning algorithm. It can recommend the optimal build parameters for binder jetting (a kind of 3D printer) machine.

##Introduction
Do you know 3D printer？ Have you ever used it? You may know that there are a lot of parameters should be set before printing. It's sometimes thicky because the parameters always affect the end-product propertres. This app helps user to choose the optimal setting parameters.

##How it works?
I have done a lot of experiments on this 3D printer, and I conclude 4 key parameters. And
